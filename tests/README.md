# Introduction

The JSON-LD* Test Suite is a set of tests that can
be used to verify JSON-LD Processor for the RDF* extensions to JSON-LD.

More information and an RDFS definition of the test vocabulary can be found at [vocab](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-api/tests/vocab).

# Design

Tests are run broadly the same as those for the core JSON-LD test suite, with the addition of the `rdfstar` option set to `true` for each test. If not set, explicitly, the test checks for proper behavior when not operating in RDF* mode.

Tests driven from a top-level [manifest](manifest.jsonld) and are defined into [compact](compact-manifest.jsonld), [expand](expand-manifest.jsonld), [flatten](flatten-manifest.jsonld), [fromRdf](fromRdf-manifest.jsonld), and [toRdf](toRdf-manifest.jsonld) sections:

# Running tests

The top-level [manifest](manifest.jsonld) references the specific test manifests, which in turn reference each test associated with a particular type of behavior.

Implementations create their own infrastructure for running the test suite. In particular, the following should be considered:

* Tests may also have a `requires` property, indicating some optional behavior described by a test vocabulary term.

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute a new test or a fix to an existing test,
please follow these steps:

1. Notify the JSON-LD mailing list, public-json-ld-wg@w3.org,
   that you will be creating a new test or fix and the purpose of the
   change.
2. Clone the git repository: git://github.com/json-ld/json-ld-star.git
3. Make your changes and submit them via github, or via a 'git format-patch'
   to the [JSON-LD Community Group mailing list](mailto:public-linked-json@w3.org).
